<h1>The World As We Know It</h1>
<h2>A Brief Description</h2>
<p>If we keep on cutting down trees and letting out greenhouse gases there will be no world by the end of this mass production. Some just people don't care about what they do to this world even if it's our only chance at survival.
Others are estimating how long we will live if this keeps on going. NASA, Spacex and even ESA are trying to estimate how long this will be happening before it's mass extinction with Sentinel-6.</p>
<h2>The Worlds Oceans</h2>
<p>The oceans around  the world are slowly becoming a dump site as people are still dumping their rubbish into drains and pipes that lead out into open ocean and becominh a part of the 250,00 million bits of rubbish by 2050. The comparison with fish and rubbish by this time would be 230,000 million fish to 250,000 million pieces of rubbish. The worlds fish are also at a high risk because with this much rubbish in the ocean predators are most likely to mistake these pieces of rubbish for fish and eat it and die, one way for the food chain to be unbalanced. The ways we can help are stop dumping rubbish into the ocean, taking female and male predators like sharks and breed them to have a balanced food chain, and also to breed some minor predators which don't feed on plankton (plankton is a type of small animal) the type of animals that fee on plankton are whale sharks yes, such a big animal feeds on something so small and other types of fish. We also need to breed surgeon fish as they keep algae away from coral reefs.</p>
<h2>Climate Change</h2>
<p>The worlds biggest problem "climate change" is bringing devastaion and world-wide cataclysm to Earth and we have to act fast otherwise life as we know it will be gone for good as there is no going back once it's happened it's like the inner atmosphere wil colapse on it's self. the </p>
